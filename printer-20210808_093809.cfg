# Rat Rig V-core 3 Klipper Config

# The first thing you'll need to do is go through this file and comment out / uncomment 
# the files and/or settings you need.
# You'll be able to print just fine with this config as it is, but it is recommended
# that you follow these steps to properly calibrate your printer:
# 0) Sanity check and PID Tuning: https://www.klipper3d.org/Config_checks.html
# 1) Pressure Advance: https://www.klipper3d.org/Pressure_Advance.html
# 2) Skew Correction: https://www.klipper3d.org/skew_correction.html
# 3) Resonance Compensation: https://www.klipper3d.org/Resonance_Compensation.html

### Stepper mechanical overrides
[stepper_x]
dir_pin: x_dir_pin # Add ! in front of pin name to reverse X stepper direction
rotation_distance: 40 # 40 for 20 tooth 2GT pulleys, 32 for 16 tooth 2GT pulleys

[stepper_y]
dir_pin: y_dir_pin # Add ! in front of pin name to reverse Y stepper direction
rotation_distance: 40 # 40 for 20 tooth 2GT pulleys, 32 for 16 tooth 2GT pulleys

[stepper_z]
dir_pin: z0_dir_pin # Add ! in front of pin name to reverse Z stepper direction
rotation_distance: 4 # 4 for TR8*4 lead screws

[stepper_z1]
dir_pin: z1_dir_pin # Add ! in front of pin name to reverse Z1 direction
rotation_distance: 4 # 4 for TR8*4 lead screws

[stepper_z2]
dir_pin: z2_dir_pin # Add ! in front of pin name to reverse Z2 direction
rotation_distance: 4 # 4 for TR8*4 lead screws

[extruder]
dir_pin: !e_dir_pin # Remove ! in front of pin name to reverse extruder direction

# Uncomment this next line if you have an ADXL345 connected to the SKR PRO

### HOMING
# BL Touch

# Inductive/Capacitive probe

#[probe]
#z_offset: 0.0 # Adjust this to fit your setup
#pin: ^!probe_pin # Change this to suit your probe (NPN/PNP NO/NC) if necessary.

# Physical endstops
#[include config/printers/v-core-3/physical-endstops.cfg]
#[safe_z_home]
#home_xy_position: 150,150 # 300mm printer
#home_xy_position: 200,200 # 400mm printer

# Endstop position
# Adjust this to your setup
# Note: might need fine tuning.
#[stepper_y]
#position_endstop: 300  # 300mm printer

# Sensorless homing (Beware: this requires manual tinkering and does not work if your x/y stepper drivers
# have clipped DIAG pins). It is strongly encouraged to use physical endstops if you're a beginner.
# If you still wish to proceed, copy config/templates/sensorless-homing.cfg to the root directory and 
# remove the # from the line below.
[include sensorless-homing.cfg]

### PHYSICAL DIMENSIONS
# Remove the # from your printer size below. 
# Similarly add a # in front of [include config/printers/v-core-3/300.cfg] if you have a bigger machine.
